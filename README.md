# Project : Compare effect of regularization
This project uses the load_diabetes dataset from sklearn to build and evaluate a regression model that predicts disease progression based on medical features. It cover:
- Load and explore the diabetes dataset
- Split data into train/test sets
- Train and explain 3 models of linear regression : OLS, Ridge, and Lasso 
- Compare performance using MSE
- Visualize learning curves and train–test errors
- Analyze feature coefficients
- Conclusion
